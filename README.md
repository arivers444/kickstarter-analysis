The most successful play campaigns had a goal of less than $5,000 with success decreasing with increasing goal amounts.  It is suggested that the data be further dissected to determine cause of the intermittent success of campaigns with goal amounts over $35,000.  The data analyzed in this case does not provide details as to the distribution of the funding budget. 

The findings suggest that the most successful theater campaigns are launched in May and June. Additionally, December does not seem to be a good time to launch a campaign.
