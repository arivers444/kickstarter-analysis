In order to determine the number of Kickstarter campaigns able to reach their fundraising goals, we have analyzed outcomes of campaigns based on goal amounts.  Looking at the above graph, we can see that the most successful play campaigns had a goal of less than $5,000 with success decreasing with increasing goal amounts. It is suggested that the data be further dissected to determine cause of the intermittent success of campaigns with goal amounts over $35,000. The data analyzed in this case does not provide details as to the distribution of the funding budget. 

Additionally, we analyzed the data to determine if the start date of the campaign had any effect on the outcome.  The findings suggest that the most successful theater campaigns are launched in May and June.  Additionally, December does not seem to be a good time to launch a campaign.  It may also be of further use to determine if the length of the campaign has any influence on the outcome.  Perhaps longer campaigns are more successful or vice versa.
